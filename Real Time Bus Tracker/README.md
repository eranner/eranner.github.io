##Real Time Bus Tracker

This is a simple application that took the same sort of formula the MIT bus schedule exercise used. Instead, I set it to my home town of Honesdale, Pennsylvania. Instead of a bus schedule, which this small town certainly DOES NOT have, I changed it to display the coordinates of the best restaurants to visit in the town of Honesdale.

**How To Run:

Use is very simple. All that needs to be done is user must click on the button that says "Click To See Our Suggestions" and the program will automatically show where the establishment is located the name of said establishment.

**Roadmap of future improvements:

This is an extremely simple application, with a ton of room for improvement. A nice touch would be a switcher that let's you choose between bars, restaurants, shops, etc. A "STOP" button could be implemented which could then show information about the business (ie. phone number, website, menu, hours, etc.)
