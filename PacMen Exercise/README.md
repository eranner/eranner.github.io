<h1>PacMen Exercise</h1>

This is an exercise used to demonstrate setInterval and DOM Manipulation throught JavaScript. The primary lesson learned in this activity were using the width of the
client to actually tell the pacmen to switch directions and using the native JavaScript Math methods to generate random data for the difference in how the pacmen move
and where they start on the page.

**How To Run**

This is very simple to use. Click the 'Add PacMan' button to generate a new PacMan on the screen. When you are satisfied with the amount of PacMen, click the 'start game'
button and this will put them in motion. PacMen can be added after the game has started if you would like to do so.

**Roadmap of future improvements**

Obviously they are many things that could be improved about this project. My first thought would be to have a fun and eye catching background image or video.
The pacmen could certainly change direction and face whichever wall they are aimed at.

Something else that could be fun is having the pacmen not only bounce off of the walls of the browser, but also off of eachother
