`#`Eye Exercise

This exercise combines all three of the languages we have learned, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. CSS obviousy is there for the colors, but is also used to create the shapes
whether that be the eyes or the pupils. The basic function of this page is to have the pupils of the eyes follow the location of the mouse location.

**How To Run**
This application is extremely simple. All one needs to do is mouse over the page and the eyes will follow.

**Roadmap of Future Improvements**

This would benefit greatly from setting the ability of the user to put as many eyes on the page as they would like.
Another div shoud be added around the pupil to allow for the iris. This way, the user could be given a selector to change the iris color.
